### Preparation
Go to `Desktop` and type the following commands
```
wget https://github.com/cclim0505/linuxDEMO/archive/main.zip
unzip main.zip
cd linux DEMO-main/tutorial01
bash generate_files.sh
```

if `unzip` is not installed, install with `sudo apt install unzip` for
Ubuntu/Debian based systems. System will prompt for a password, which is the one
you used when creating your user or installing linux.

After the last command, use `ls` and you should see some new sample text files.

### Navigating and manipulating files & directories

Use `cat filename` to see what's inside the file.

Try `tac filename` and see what happens.

Type `rm sample_text?` to remove some of the sample files. Check with `ls`.

Type `bash generate_files.sh` again.

Type `mkdir folder_test`, then `ls`.

Type `mv sample_text? folder_test`, then `ls folder_test`.
