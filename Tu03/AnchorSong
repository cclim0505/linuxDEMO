Verse 1:
There’s an emblem fair that is known to all,
A sign to help us through,
It stands for strength and it stands for right,
An Anchor tried and true.
The emblem of The Boys’ Brigade
It helps us on our way,
Our father’s knew in days gone by
This sign we know to-day.

Chorus:
“Sure and Stedfast”
The Brigade Boys’ motto clear
That’s our watch-word
when trouble and trials are near.
“Sure and Stedfast”
to the flag that flies above
In all that we do we’ll try to be true
To the Anchor that we love

Verse 2:
With gallant heart and gallant soul,
On life’s broad sea we’ll sail,
What-e’er storms of life may bring,
Our Anchor must prevail,
Although the clouds may cross the sun,
And skies grow dark and grey,
We’ll face the foe until we’ve won,
A glorious victory.

[Chorus]
